# CISC/CMPE 204 Test Project

Welcome to the test project for CISC/CMPE 204. This project serves the following purposes:

1. Establishes that you are able to use GitHub and the classroom setup for this course.

2. Connects your GitHub profile to the GitHub Classroom entry for you.

3. Ensures that you are able to use the software for both propositional semantics and your major project.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository or open it in Repl.It (a button should appear in this repository on GitHub -- refresh may be necessary)
    - If you are new to Git / GitHub, or just want a refresher, see [here](https://guides.github.com/).
    - If you are doing things locally, make sure you install the latest version of the [`python-nnf`](https://github.com/QuMuLab/python-nnf) package.
    - **Tip**: You may need to go to Repl.It first, log in, and _then_ open this project using the button. Not doing so can be buggy at times.

2. Modify line 9 of `run.py` to return a logic sentence of the form specified in line 8.
    - **Hint**: You can use `(X | Y)` for "X or Y", `(X & Y)` for "X and Y", and `~X` for "not X".

3. Run `run.py` to see if it prints something expected.

4. Commit and push your changes to the repository to have it automatically graded (you can do this as often as you'd like).

## Help

See the demo video in the course Tutorials (OnQ > CISC/CMPE 204 > Content > Tutorials) that demonstrates much of GitHub and Repl.It, as it pertains to this assignment and the course project.
